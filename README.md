## Who am I and what am I looking for?
Information technology engineer and manager, 33 years old, living in Bordeaux, France.

After 8 years in the tech field as a network and security engineer, where I learned lots of things and grow up as an engineer and a human being, I understood that I was happier and better leading a team and helping its members to grow. 

I seized the opportuny offered by OVHcloud to manage one – and then two – teams of software engineers.<br>
Today, I love this mission and I am eager to continue in a challenging environment with great ambition, to build strong teams and achieve big projects.
